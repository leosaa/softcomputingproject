\textbf{\textit{Abstract} -
Human voice is central to almost all human activities and is the key indicator of our behaviour. Every time we talk the human voice reflecs our mood or the way we are feeling at a particular moment and can often reveal our underlaying emotions in other words our emotions and sentiments. Speech Emotional Recognition of the Voice is the subject of this study. Emotional recognition has been studied for a long time based on facial expressions, but emotional recognition based on speech has only been
studied in recent years, which seeks to categorize emotions according to variances in speech patterns like tone or annunciation. Since early 2000, speach recognition has grown to be one of the most active research areas in natural language processing, the emotional recognition has emerge in the last five years and there are several reasons for this. First, it has a wide
arrange of applications, almost in every domain. The industry surrounding emotion recongnition and analysis has also flourished due to the proliferation of commercial application and second, it offers many challenging research problems which is conducted by this study applying the machine learning technics reviewd in this class.}
